# Notes and Cheat sheets 

This repo contains the various notes and cheat sheets I've made (or discovered)
as I was learning various tools, libraries, and languages. Each cheat sheet 
I've made comes in three forms:

* _name_.md - Standard github markdown 
* _name_sheet.md - Pandoc markdown 
* _name_.html

The first is viewable on github, the second is viewable in any text editor, and
the last is viewable in any browser. I maintain the second version 
(as its the most readable) and run pandoc to convert to the other two forms.
